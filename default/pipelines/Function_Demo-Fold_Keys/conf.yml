        We drop metrics, if the __criblMetrics field does not exist, to clean up
        samples. 


        Notes of production use of this pipeline: 


        If you CANNOT lose ANY events in production then you can try the following in lieu of using a Drop function


        1) Add the filter from the drop function to all functions in the pipeline so that events are not modified in unintended ways. The cribl_pipe field should include this pipeline (unless removed by admins) 


        2) use an eval function, with this filter, to add a field named "misroute" and a value of "sourcetype doesn't match expected value". This should allow you to ID the misrouted fields later on.
