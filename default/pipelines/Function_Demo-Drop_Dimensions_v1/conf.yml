        If you enable drop dimensions, you will see that we removed dimensions
        for which we do not care - such as nodename (redundant) release (we can
        enrich with Search later) sysname (redundant) and version (we can enrich
        with Search later - it doesn't need to be in every event). 


        you will also notice that the original events have been dropped and replacec by metrics, aggregated every 20 seconds, by the remaining dimension (host). 


        Finally, you will see that each metric has been split into it's own event (node_uname_info and node_cpu_count were originally a part of the same metric event)
